		<h2>Roasted Cauliflower Recipe</h2>
		<p>This baked cauliflower recipe is a go-to side dish like Corn on the Cob and Roasted Brussels Sprouts. It's a
			dish
			you'll make over and over.</p>
		<p>This oven-roasted cauliflower is easy and excellent. The combination of butter and olive oil caramelizes the
			florets and they are baked to crisp-tender perfection. The best thing about this recipe is that you can
			customize the seasoning with what you have on hand with great results</p>

		<h2>The Best Seasoning for Cauliflower</h2>
		<div class="body-text-seasoning">
			<div class="main-content">
				<p class="seasoning-intro">Cauliflower goes well with just about any seasoning. Even a simple salt and
					pepper
					seasoning works well.
					These are the seasonings we love most:</p>
				<ul class="seasoning-list">
					<li>Salt – we love fine sea salt</li>
					<li>Black Pepper – freshly cracked</li>
					<li>Garlic Powder – or try garlic salt</li>
					<li>Paprika – adds color and flavor (a little goes a long way)</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p class="highlight"> <b>Can I add cheese?</b> We love to add cheese to cauliflower.
				Sprinkle cauliflower with 1/2 cup
				shredded
				parmesan cheese in the last 5 minutes of cooking for a parmesan roasted cauliflower.</p>

				<p class="highlight"> <b>How to Slice Cauliflower into Steaks:</b> Slice the cauliflower
					head into 4-5 wedges. Then,
					cut the wedges
					into even 1/2″ thick steaks and break them apart into bite-sized pieces. As they are roasted, the flat
					sides caramelize against the baking sheet adding a depth of flavor. It also results in evenly browned
					pieces.</p>

		<h2>How Long to Bake Cauliflower?</h2>
		<p>The bake time for roasted cauliflower will depend on the size, thickness, and desired doneness of your
			pieces.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Smaller pieces – you only need about 15-20 minutes.</li>
			<li>Larger florets – bake 20-25 minutes. Until the cauliflower is caramelized and golden.</li>

	<section class="body-text">
		<h2>Air Fryer Instructions:</h2>
		<p>Cooking cauliflower in an air fryer is quick and easy. When air frying, I skip the butter and just use 2-3
			Tbsp olive oil. Air fry cauliflower at 375˚ for 10-15 minutes, flipping every 5 minutes, until golden and
			tender.</p>

		<h2>Make-Ahead</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> <b>Meal Prep</b> – you can pre-chop your cauliflower a few days ahead, cover and
				refrigerate then add seasoning
				before roasting.</li>
			<li> <b>Refrigerate</b> – once cooled to room temperature, you can cover and refrigerate
				leftover roasted
				cauliflower for up to 3 days.</li>
			<li> <b>Reheating</b> – You can reheat the cauliflower on the stovetop, oven, or air fryer
				just until heated
				through.</li>
