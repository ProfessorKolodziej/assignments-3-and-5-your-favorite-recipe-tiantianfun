		<h2>Roasted Cauliflower Recipe</h2>
		<p>This baked cauliflower recipe is a go-to side dish like Corn on the Cob and Roasted Brussels Sprouts. It's a
			dish
			you'll make over and over.</p>
		<p>This oven-roasted cauliflower is easy and excellent. The combination of butter and olive oil caramelizes the
			florets and they are baked to crisp-tender perfection. The best thing about this recipe is that you can
			customize the seasoning with what you have on hand with great results</p>

		<h2>The Best Seasoning for Cauliflower</h2>
		<p>Cauliflower goes well with just about any seasoning. Even a simple salt and pepper seasoning works well.
			These are the seasonings we love most:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Salt – we love fine sea salt</li>
			<li>Black Pepper – freshly cracked</li>
			<li>Garlic Powder – or try garlic salt</li>
			<li>Paprika – adds color and flavor (a little goes a long way)</li>
		</ul>
		<div>
			<p>Can I add cheese? we love to add cheese to cauliflower. Sprinkle cauliflower with 1/2 cup shredded
				parmesan cheese in the last 5 minutes of cooking for a parmesan roasted cauliflower.</p>

		<h2>How to Roast Cauliflower</h2>
		<p>This roasted cauliflower recipe is so easy to make and uses ingredients you most likely already have on hand
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 425˚F and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easier cleanup. </li>
			<li>Slice the cauliflower into traditional florets or into flat cauliflower steaks.</li>
			<li>Seasoning- Add the cauliflower to the center of your baking sheet, drizzle with oil and butter, and toss
				to coat. Season the cauliflower and toss again then spread into a single layer.</li>
			<li>Bake cauliflower for 15-20 minutes, or until desired tenderness and golden at the edges. The baking time
				may vary depending on the size of your pieces.</li>
		</ol>

		<div>
			<p>How to Slice Cauliflower into Steaks: Slice the cauliflower head into 4-5 wedges. Then, cut the wedges
				into even 1/2″ thick steaks and break them apart into bite-sized pieces. As they are roasted, the flat
				sides caramelize against the baking sheet adding a depth of flavor. It also results in evenly browned
				pieces.</p>

		<h2>How Long to Bake Cauliflower?</h2>
		<p>The bake time for roasted cauliflower will depend on the size, thickness, and desired doneness of your
			pieces.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Smaller pieces – you only need about 15-20 minutes.</li>
			<li>Larger florets – bake 20-25 minutes. Until the cauliflower is caramelized and golden.</li>

		<h2>Air Fryer Instructions:</h2>
		<p>Cooking cauliflower in an air fryer is quick and easy. When air frying, I skip the butter and just use 2-3
			Tbsp olive oil. Air fry cauliflower at 375˚ for 10-15 minutes, flipping every 5 minutes, until golden and
			tender.</p>

		<h2>Make-Ahead</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Meal Prep – you can pre-chop your cauliflower a few days ahead, cover and refrigerate then add seasoning
				before roasting.</li>
			<li>Refrigerate – once cooled to room temperature, you can cover and refrigerate leftover roasted
				cauliflower for up to 3 days.</li>
			<li>Reheating – You can reheat the cauliflower on the stovetop, oven, or air fryer just until heated
				through.</li>
		</ul>
